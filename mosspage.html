<h2 id="aboutme" class="header">about me</h2>
<p>i absolutely love polar bears. they're like dogs of the arctic. i think the government is hindering me by not allowing me to own a polar bear.</p>
<p>there's no reason i shouldn't be able to own a polar bear. i mean come on,, they're just so silly. additionally, why can't i own a capybara?? the state of idaho is discriminating against me (because i am <b>trans</b>) and stopping me from getting a pet capybara</p>
<h2 id="why"class="header">why make a website?</h2>
<p>i think that making a website is a valuable way to learn css and html, and also i thought it would be fun to put a picture of a capybara there</p>
<h2 id="favorites" class="header">favorite characters</h2>
<p>i absolutely love so many silly characters.</p>
